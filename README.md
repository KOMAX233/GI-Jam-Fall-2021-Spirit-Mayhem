Short description:
In Spirit Mayhem, you play as a witch travelling through an afterlife filled with spirits. You are under constant attack by evil ghosts, who cast powerful magical spells to defeat you. However, you can ally with good spirits to borrow their magic powers to fight back.
The game levels and all the spells are entirely procedurally generated. There’s no way to predict what you’ll run into next, and you don’t even know what your own spells do until you use them. You’ll have to keep learning how to use your spells and how to evade the enemies’ spells for as long as you play.

You have to keep finding new spirits for not being alone, or they will leave you and make you lonely again. And the evil ghosts also want you be lonely so they attack you. You die when you are the loneliest.
